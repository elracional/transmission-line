# Transmission line. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_chart
In radio-frequency engineering, a transmission line is a specialized cable or other structure designed to conduct alternating 
current of radio frequency, that is, currents with a frequency high enough that their wave nature must be taken into account. 
Transmission lines are used for purposes such as connecting radio transmitters and receivers with their antennas (they are then 
called feed lines or feeders), distributing cable television signals, trunklines routing calls between telephone switching centres,
computer network connections and high speed computer data buses.

The Smith chart, invented by Phillip H. Smith (1905â€“1987),[1][2] and T. Mizuhashi,[3] is a graphical calculator or nomogram 
designed for electrical and electronics engineers specializing in radio frequency (RF) engineering to assist in solving problems 
with transmission lines and matching circuits.[4][5] The Smith chart can be used to simultaneously display multiple parameters 
including impedances, admittances, reflection coefficients, {\displaystyle S_{nn}\,}S_{{nn}}\, scattering parameters, noise 
figure circles, constant gain contours and regions for unconditional stability, including mechanical vibrations analysis.
[6][7]:93-103 The Smith chart is most frequently used at or within the unity radius region. However, the remainder is still 
mathematically relevant, being used, for example, in oscillator design and stability analysis.[7]:98-101 While the use of paper 
Smith charts for solving the complex mathematics involved in matching problems has been largely replaced by software based methods, 
the Smith charts display is still the preferred method of displaying how RF parameters behave at one or more frequencies, 
an alternative to using tabular information. Thus most RF circuit analysis software includes a Smith chart option for the 
display of results and all but the simplest impedance measuring instruments can display measured results on a Smith chart display.
